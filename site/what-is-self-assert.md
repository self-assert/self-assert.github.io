# What is `self-assert`?

`self-assert` is a small TypeScript library that helps you model
valid domain objects and assisting their creation through guided assistants.

It encourages expressing validation **inside the domain model** â€” not in external
schemas, UI forms, or controllers.
This results in software that is easier to evolve, test, and reason about.

Inspired by object-oriented design principles, the library promotes:

- **Encapsulation of rules** inside your domain objects
- **Valid construction** over defensive validation
- **Clarity and consistency** across the system
